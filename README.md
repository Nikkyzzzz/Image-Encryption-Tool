# [Image Encryption Tool](https://nikkyzzzz.github.io/Image-Encryption-Tool/)

Welcome to the **Image Encryption Tool** project! This tool allows you to apply simple encryption techniques to images using pixel manipulation. Users can swap pixel values or apply basic mathematical operations to each pixel. The tool is designed with a clean, professional interface and can be easily used by uploading an image file.

## Features

- **Upload an Image**: Load an image file to apply encryption operations.
- **Swap Pixels**: Swap pixel values to obscure the image.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Apply operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to modify pixel values.
- **Undo Feature**: Revert to the previous state if needed.

## Usage

### 1. Upload an Image
Click on the "Choose File" button to upload an image from your local device.

### 2. Apply Encryption Operations
Use the available buttons to apply the desired operation:
- **Swap Pixels**: Swaps specific pixels in the image.
- **Add 50**: Increases the RGB values of all pixels by 50.
- **Subtract 50**: Decreases the RGB values of all pixels by 50.
- **Multiply by 1.2**: Multiplies the RGB values of all pixels by 1.2.
- **Divide by 1.2**: Divides the RGB values of all pixels by 1.2.

### 3. View Results
After applying an operation, the encrypted image will be displayed next to the original image for comparison.

### 4. Undo Changes
If you need to revert the last change, click the "Undo" button.
